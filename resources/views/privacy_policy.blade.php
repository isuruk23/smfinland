                                    from our Services. On behalf of the children parents can provide the details in

                                <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage
                                    and to help enforce
                                    this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information
                                    through the Website and
                                    Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians

                                    children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed
                                    to never give out
                                    Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>

                                <h3>Use and processing of collected information</h3>

                                <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information,
                                    unless we have
                                    entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the
                                    data controller and
                                    we would be the data processor.</p>

                                <p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal
                                    Information. We act in the
                                    capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information
                                    that is necessary to
                                    ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we are a
                                    data controller
                                    because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal
                                    Information.</p>

                                <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal
                                    Information through
                                    the Website and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the
                                    submitted Personal
                                    Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your
                                    instructions. In such
                                    instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>

                                <p>In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal
                                    obligation, we may need to
                                    collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information
                                    that we request, we
                                    may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the
                                    information we collect
                                    from you may be used for the following purposes</p>

                                    more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the
                                    performance of an agreement
                                    with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is
                                    necessary for compliance
                                    with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a
                                    task that is carried out in
                                    the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v)
                                    processing is necessary for the
                                    purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. We may also
                                    combine or aggregate
                                    some of your Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve and
                                    update our Website
                                    and Services.</p>

                                <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you

                                    processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the
                                    legal bases. In any case,
                                    we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
                                    and in particular whether
                                    the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or
                                    a requirement
                                    necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

                                    the retention period
                                    expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the

                                <h3>Data analytics</h3>

                                <p>Our Website and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web
                                    beacons, or other
                                    similar information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and
                                    usage information.
                                </p><p>The information gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User activity such
                                    as how often Users
                                    visit our Website and Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc. We use
                                    the information
                                    obtained from these analytics tools to monitor the performance and improve our
                                    Website and Services.
                                </p><p>We do not use third-party analytics tools to track or to collect any personally
                                    identifiable information of
                                    our Users and we will not associate any information gathered from the statistical
                                    reports with any
                                    individual User</p>

                                <h3>Do Not Track signals</h3>

                                <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit
                                    that you do not want
                                    to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or
                                    collecting information in
                                    connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting
                                    personally identifiable
                                    information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move
                                    across different
                                    websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet
                                    uniform. As a result,
                                    the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track
                                    signals communicated
                                    by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we
                                    limit our use and
                                    collection of your Personal Information. For a description of Do Not Track protocols

                                    of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission
