                        This season can be define as the dry and best sunshine season in Maldives.
                        For this period, Maldives expects a huge number of tourists. Normally, all
                        the resorts are fully occupied and advance booking are recommended.
                        Christmas &amp; New Year Period
                        All resorts &amp; Hotels are very busiest during this period. Rates for the
                        accommodations for these periods are very higher, just like all the other
                        famous destinations in the world. Hence, we highly recommended the advance
                        booking for this period.
                        May to November
                        Cheaper room rates, plenty of offers and add-ons can be obtained in this low
                        season. You may experience, shower rain lasting not more than 15-20 minutes

                        Resorts are considered or we can say meant to be place where people come to
                        relax and enjoy their personal time with family, friends, and colleagues or
                        with self. It becomes very important to take a break from the busy schedule
                        of life. People nowadays understand the importance of this and are making
                        out plans to go out and enjoy their vacations. Away from the city life many
                        tend to be with nature enjoying its beauty, some prefer beaches while some
                        even try adventure sports! You should not choose a resort based on just
                        price. But you should check everything from location of the resorts, quality
                        of food to island condition, facilities in the rooms, features and other
                        facilities etc. Always, feel free to discuss this with our team prior to
